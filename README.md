## TL;DR
A base css file for new projects, where a uniform "template style" syntax is needed!

<br />

# Project Overview
Base CSS was created after building a template style syntax in each of my projects. I wanted a way to reuse this code each time I started a new project. Base CSS was added into my template (which is on GitHub), but I thought I'd launch it in a separate repo for ease of use!
